# Project: HCT2CT
# HCT2CT is to convert helical/spiral CT (HCT) projections to virtual CT projections for parallel X-ray beam
  # main.py is for converting all HCT projections to virtual CT projections
  # test.py is for checking if the current parameters are correct for converting with a single virtual CT projection. If the parameters are correct, then run main.py for converting all HCT projections to virtual CT projections
  # hct2ct.py is the core function for realizing the converting
