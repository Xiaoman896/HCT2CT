# Project: HCT2CT
HCT2CT is to convert helical/spiral CT (HCT) projections to virtual CT projections for parallel X-ray beam

# How to use
  1) HCTcheck.py: is for checking if the current parameters are correct for converting with a single virtual CT projection. If the parameters are correct, then run main.py for converting all HCT projections to virtual CT projections
  2) HCTconvert.py: is for converting all HCT projections to virtual CT projections
  3) hct2ct.py: is the core function for realizing the converting
